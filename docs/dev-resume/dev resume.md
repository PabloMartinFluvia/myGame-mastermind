## Intro
This project has been used for practice:

1. Developement starts when a minimum knowledge of the language has been reached.
2. Requisites and "expected level of code quality" evolves.
3. When something new is requested to be applied, that task is implemented in a new branch.
    - Obs: old branch remains, to make it easier future comparisions.

## Tasks - Branches
Task's description contains what's <i>new</i> vs previous task.

### Task 0: js_v0.0
- Task:
    - Implement vasic version only with functions.
- Basic version.
- Process Oriented Programing.
- Imperative programing.

### Task 1: js_v0.1
- Task:
    - Upgrade previous task using objects <b>without methods</b> (aka structs, registers, etc...).
- Design Principles to practice:
    - KISS.
    - Self explanatory: naming, comments, format.
    - Consistent code: standards, coherence, alerts.
    - Minimum code: dead code, YAGNI, DRY.

### Task 2: js_v0.2.1, js_v0.2.2, js_v0.2.3, js_v0.2.4
- Task:
    - Upgrade previous task usig objects with methods.
    - 4 differents versions to practice some alternatives to init objects with functions
        - simple
        - this
        - clousures
        - that / factory pattern
- Object Oriented Programing combined with some free functions.
