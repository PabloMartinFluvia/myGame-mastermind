## Intro
This project has been used for practice:

1. Developement starts when a minimum knowledge of the language has been reached.
2. Requisites and "expected level of code quality" evolves.
3. When something new is requested to be applied, that task is implemented in a new branch.
    - Obs: old branch remains, to make it easier future comparisions.
